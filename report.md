# MD5 Algorithm Project Report

In this project from the Theory of Algorithms Module I was tasked with developing a C program that will allow the user to perform the MD5(Message Digest Algorithm). The program must be able to calculate the MD5 hash digest (learn more here : https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321 / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 ) of an input. The user will be tasked to enter either a filw or input a string which will be stored in the user-entry.txt file that is already created in te repository.
